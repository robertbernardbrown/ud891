            <p>The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the
                <a id="focus-link" href="/">form</a> of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and
                named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed in a letter by Steve Selvin to
                the American Statistician in 1975.</p>

            <p>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the
                others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another
                door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage
                to switch your choice?</p>

                <p>It turns out contestants who switch have a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while contestants who stick to
                    their choice have only a 1/3 chance!
